<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> we have on former occasions referred to
houses with lurking-places, or secret chambers,
the subject seems to be of such interest as to
warrant our giving some further examples.</p>

<p>Plowden Hall, county of Salop, with ‘its gable
ends, high chimneys, its floors, staircases, and
doors of solid oak, and walls covered with oak
panelling,’ is described as being full of nooks and
corners. There is a hiding-hole in the closet of
one of the bedrooms, where the boards of the
flooring are so arranged as to be easily moved;
and underneath is a trap-door, by which a small
ladder leads down into a dark hole where there is
just room enough for a man to change his position
with ease from a standing to a sitting posture.
There is a shelf, on which the concealed person
could eat his food. Tradition states that a priest
was actually concealed there for a fortnight whilst
Cromwell’s soldiers were posted outside the gates;
and that these were obliged to leave without
having discovered him. Besides this hiding-place,
there is an escape about the width and form of a
chimney, reaching from one of the bedrooms down
to the ground-floor of the house, to which a man
might be lowered by means of a rope. There is
also an outlet over the chapel through two trap-doors
on to the roof, where a person might escape
between the eaves of the house; and a portion of
the flooring of the chapel is so formed as to lift
up and cover a hiding-place below for concealing
the sacred vessels.</p>

<p>Raglan Castle, Hallam, Derbyshire; Maple-Durham
House, Oxon; Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk;
Coughton Hall, Warwickshire; Harrowden, the
seat of the Lords Vaux; and the old Manor-house,
Long Clawson, each has its lurking-holes
and secret chamber. That in the last named
quaint, old, picturesque-looking house is reached
by the chimney of one of the sitting-rooms.</p>

<p>‘White Welles House, which lies on the borders
of Enfield Chase, is said to have been’ full of
holes, dark mysterious vaults, and subterranean
passages.</p>

<p>Recusants and priests found refuge in Little
Malvern Court in the days of their persecution,
the position of one or two hiding-places in the
roof being still pointed out.</p>

<p>A secret chamber in Lowstock Hall, in the
parish of Bolton, Lancashire, which was pulled
down in 1816, was associated with blood-stains
on the hearthstone of one of the rooms, and
the supposed murder of a priest in the troublous
times.</p>

<p>In connection with Yorkshire, the old Red
House is made mention of as having had a secret
chamber and gallery underneath the roof. These
were brought to light some years ago when workmen
were employed in making repairs and alterations
on the mansion. The noted royalist, Sir
Henry Slingsby, lay for a time concealed in the
hiding-place thus skilfully contrived; but venturing
forth one moonlight night to enjoy the
freedom of a walk in his garden, he was seen by
a servant-man, who betrayed him to his enemies;
and soon after the gallant old colonel was seized,
conveyed to London, and beheaded on Tower
Hill.</p>

<p>Kingerby Old Hall, situated in the same county,
was also possessed of one or more secret chambers.</p>

<p>Ashbourne Place, in Sussex, which was said to
have been built by a brother of Bishop Juxon, was
often made use of as a place of refuge by that
persecuted prelate after the death of Charles I.
At the time when his royal master was beheaded,
Juxon was Bishop of London and Clerk of the
Closet; and being implicitly trusted by his royal
master, to whom he was devotedly attached,
he received his last confidences on the scaffold,
and his George, with the oft-referred-to word,
‘Remember!’ The father of the present proprietor
of Ashbourne, in opening a communication
between the back and front chambers, discovered
a room, the existence of which was previously
unknown, and to which access could only have
been gained through the chimney. In all probability,
this curious retreat was Bishop Juxon’s
hiding-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">{642}</span></p>

<p>There is a gallery situated in the attic story of
the mansion at Stanford Court, in Worcestershire,
in which Arthur Salwin—an ancestor of the
present proprietor of the estate, who lived in the
reigns of Elizabeth and James I.—and his four sons
and seven daughters, together with others of their
kindred, are portrayed on the oak-panelled walls
of the room in the costume of the day; the ladies
in embroidered dresses, with jewelled ornaments.
Underneath each figure is a motto in Latin.
Behind the panels are secret passages, which,
previous to the alterations of modern times,
extended over a great part of the mansion.</p>

<p>Sanston Hall, the seat of the ancient family
of Huddlestone, in Cambridgeshire, was destroyed
on account of the owner’s adherence to the ancient
faith, and rebuilt in the time of Queen Mary,
when the precaution was taken to erect a
chapel in the roof. It is approached by a winding
staircase, which also gives access to a secret
chamber. In the hiding-place near the chapel in
the roof at the top of the old winding staircase,
there were found some oyster-shells; and a fowl’s
bone was picked up in the one belonging to
Lydiate Hall—relics of some poor prisoner’s solitary
meal.</p>

<p>Upton Court, near Reading, the former residence
of the Perkyns family, has also its hidden
retreat, which is difficult of access, being approached
by a trap-door in the midst of a
chimney-stack near the lesser Hall.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the present, or the
end of last century, a secret chamber was accidentally
discovered in the ancient mansion of
Bourton-on-the-Water, a ‘large rambling house of
many gables,’ situated in Gloucestershire. The
door appeared on tearing off the paper which
was about to be removed. It was on the second
(or upper) floor landing-place, and opened into a
small chamber about eight feet square, containing
a chair and a table. On the back of the former
lay a black robe; and the whole had the appearance
as if some one had recently risen from his
seat and left the room. On the same floor there
were several other apartments, of which three
only were in use, the other (called the Dark
Room) having been locked up for many years.
Of the three in use, one was styled the Chapel,
and another the Priest’s Room. The former
had a vaulted roof or ceiling. All three were
supposed by the villagers to be haunted, and
they had been known by the above appellations
in the family long anterior to the discovery of
the door. This interesting old mansion was sold
in 1608 to Sir Thomas Edwards, treasurer of
the royal household, and subsequently privy-councillor
to Charles I., and it was probably
during his occupancy that Charles is said to
have passed the first night there on his way from
Oxford. Since 1834, this house—except a small
part of the south front—was pulled down, the
fine old trees in which it was embosomed felled,
the shrubberies made away with, the pleasure-grounds
converted into pasture, and the remains
of the house into a dispensary!</p>

<p>The hiding-place in Heale House, near Amesbury,
in Wilts, for several days formed a retreat
for King Charles II. after the battle of Worcester.</p>

<p>In the course of this century, a movable panel
was discovered in a small panelled room in the
old manor-house of Chelvey, county of Somerset.
This aperture, for some unexplained reason, was
closed up hastily, and the spring by which it
was opened was said to be lost. In an adjoining
room, which was much larger, and panelled in
a similar manner, there was a cupboard, the
floor of which—afterwards nailed down—had been
formerly movable. Underneath was a short
flight of steps, which again ascended, and led to
a pretty long but very narrow room at the back
of the fireplace. This concealed chamber was
furnished with an iron sconce projecting from
the wall, to hold a candle, and was also provided
with a small fireplace.</p>

<p>Parham, which belongs to the Curzon family,
has a secret chamber close to the chapel in the
roof of the house, and the way down to it is
through a bench standing out from the wall.</p>

<p>Captain Duthy, in his <i>History of Hampshire</i>,
says ‘that the old house at Hinton-Ampner, in
that county, was subjected to the evil report
of being haunted; that strange and unaccountable
circumstances did occur there, by which the
peace and comfort of a most respectable and
otherwise strong-minded lady, at that time occupier
of the mansion, were essentially interfered
with by noises and interruptions that to her
appeared awful and unearthly, and which finally
led to her giving up the house. Afterwards,
on its being taken down, it was discovered that
in the thickness of the walls were secret passages
and stairs not generally known to exist, which
afforded peculiar facilities for any one carrying
on without detection the mysteries of a haunted
house.’</p>

<p>The following extract, taken from a state paper
in the public Record Office, is preserved among
others relating to the Rebellion of 1745, and
obviously has reference to the search that was
being made all over the country for suspected
persons. Worksop Manor as it then stood is
said to have been burned down in 1761. Examination
of Elizabeth Brown, taken upon oath
before Richard Bagshaw, the 24th November
1745—‘Who says that nine years ago last spring,
upon that Easter Monday, she, Catherine Marshall,
and another young woman, went to Worksop
Manor to see Elizabeth Walkden, who lived as
a servant with the Duke of Norfolk there; and
desiring to look at the house, the said Elizabeth
Walkden, she believed, showed them most
of the rooms of the house; and at last coming
upon the leads of the house, and walking and
looking about them, the said Elizabeth Walkden
said she would let them see a greater variety
than they had yet seen; after which she raised
up the ledge of a sheet of lead with her knife
till she got her fingers under it, and then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">{643}</span>
desired them to assist her, which they did; and
then under that she took up a trap-door where
there was a flight of stairs, which they went
down, into a little room which was all dark;
that the said Elizabeth Walkden opening the
window-shutter, there was a fireplace, a bed, and
a few chairs in the said room; and asking her
what use that room was for, she said it was to
hide people in trouble—sometimes. Then the
said Elizabeth Walkden went to the side of the
room next to the stair-foot, and opened a door
in the wainscot about the middle of the height
of the room, which they looked into, but it being
dark, they could not see anything in it; but the
said Elizabeth Walkden said they could not go
into it, as it was full of arms; upon which the
said Elizabeth Walkden shut the door, and they
went up-stairs; and then she shut the trap-door,
and laid down the sheet of lead as it was before,
which was so nice she could not discern it from
another part of the leads, and believes she could
not find it if she were there again.’</p>

<p>In a very old house entered from the High
Street of Canterbury, and nearly facing Mersey
Lane, which leads straight to the cathedral, one
of the rooms had a window opening into an
adjoining church. In the thickness of the walls
there were two or three secret stairs. It was
said to have been a nunnery formerly; and that
a subterranean passage, it was ascertained, used
to unite it with the cathedral.</p>

<p>Woodcote, Hampshire; Coldham House, Suffolk;
Watcomb and Maple-Durham, Berkshire; Stonyhurst
in Lancashire; Treago, Herefordshire; Harborough
Hall, situated midway between Hagley
and Kidderminster, all had their secret chambers;
and the ancient seat of the Tichbornes was similarly
provided, together with a complication of
secret passages and stairs.</p>

<p>Compton Wynyates, a remote and picturesque
mansion belonging to the Marquis of Northampton,
has an upper chapel in the topmost gable,
with ancient wooden altar, three staircases leading
to the Priest’s room in the lower story, secret
passages, and hiding-places behind the wainscoting
spacious enough to hold one hundred persons
in case of alarm. The existence of such a
chapel sufficiently indicates that the rites of the
old religion were practised in private, although
the Protestant place of worship remained open
below.</p>

<p>In Essex, the Wisemans of Braddox or Broadoaks
were of the number of those who suffered
during the reigns of Elizabeth and James for their
noted ‘harbouring of priests.’ In <i>P. R. O. Dom.
Elizabeth</i>, vol. 244, n. 7, may be seen two forms of
indictment of Richard Jackson, priest, for saying
mass at Braddox, and of various members of
the Wiseman family for being present at mass on
the 25th August and the 8th of September 1592.
Again: ‘Mr Worseley and Mr Newall have been
to Widow Wiseman’s house in Essex, and found
a mass preparing; but the priest escaped.’ There
were two hiding-places in Braddox: the most
important of these adjoined the chapel, and was
constructed in a thick wall of the chimney, behind
a finely laid and carved mantel-piece.</p>

<p>In connection with the old mansion of the
Carylls at West Grinstead, the Abbé Denis tells
us that it also has two hiding-places. ‘One of
these is between the mantel-piece and ceiling of
the dining-room; and the way to get to it is
to go up the flue of the chimney as high as the
ceiling of the room on the second floor; and
then, by an aperture in the side of the chimney
or flue, to drop down into the hiding-hole.
Another opening also exists in the chimney of
the room above. The second place of concealment
is quite underneath the roof of the house.
It had likewise two ways of access—the one
from an attic, the other from a closet or small
room underneath.’ In Benton, the original seat
of the Carylls in Sussex, there is one on the
ground-floor between two kitchen chimneys,
which is entered by an opening in the room
at the back. At New Building, a house more
recently erected by the Carylls, there are also
two secret rooms; one on the second floor,
formed in the thickness of the wall between
two chimneys, but entered by a concealed door
in one of the two adjoining rooms. The other
is in the opposite gable, and is entered from the
room on the ground-floor below, through the
top of a cupboard which stands in the wall
close to the chimney.</p>

<p>The walls of the ‘ancient moated and turreted
mansion’ of Lyford, Berks, were ‘pierced with
concealed galleries and hiding-places;’ one of
the latter was excavated in the wall above the
gateway.</p>

<p>Several ‘hiding-holes’ have also come to light
in the fine old house of Sutton Place, near
Guildford, Surrey; and some years ago, a ‘most
beautifully embossed leather casket, iron-bound,
containing relics of some of the martyred priests,’
was found in one of these places of concealment
behind the wainscot panelling of the chapel. A
curious printed volume entitled <i>A Sure Haven
against Shipwreck</i> was found concealed ‘between
the floor and the ceiling.’ It would seem that
Brother Nicholas Owen, alias Little John, S.J.,
‘that useful cunning joiner of those times,’ was
the constructer of many of these secret rooms,
to be found in the greater portion of our
‘stately homes of England,’ for we read in <i>Records
of the English Provinces</i> that ‘he was divers times
hung upon a Topcliff rack in the Tower of
London, to compel him to betray the hiding-places
he had made up and down the land.’
This said ‘skilful architect’ was afterwards seized,
according to the same authority, in company
with Fathers Garnet and Oldcorne, in one of the
numerous hiding-places in Hendlip House, near
Worcester, already referred to in No. 1040 of
this <i>Journal</i>. The secret chamber in which
these Jesuit Fathers were concealed is thus
described in Lingard’s <i>England</i>: ‘The opening
was from an upper room through the fireplace.
The wooden border of the hearth was made to
take up and put down like a trap-door, and the
bricks were taken out and replaced in their
courses whenever it was used.’ The former
Westons of Sutton Place were well known to
government as shelterers of priests. It was
searched on the 5th of November 1578, by order
of the Privy-council, for ‘popish priests;’ and
again on the 14th of January 1591, for one
Morgan, a ‘massing priest,’ supposed to be ‘lurking
there in secret sort.’</p>

<p>The far-famed ‘Burleigh Park by Stamford
Town’ is also in possession of a secret chamber.
This concealed apartment, of whose existence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">{644}</span>
family were altogether unaware, was brought
to light in the course of this century through
the instrumentality of the law agent, and was
found to contain furniture of an old-fashioned
description, together with several framed engravings.
These latter, when agitated by the wind,
which found its way in through a broken window-pane,
struck against the wall, thereby producing
a flapping noise, which had long procured for
the adjoining sleeping apartment the designation
of ‘the Haunted Room.’</p>

<p>The grand old historic mansion of Knebworth,
Herts, like others of similar age and importance,
possessed trap-doors, hiding-places, &amp;c.; and
underneath a room adjoining the so-styled
‘Haunted Chamber,’ and belonging to one of the
square towers of the gateway, there was a
mysterious room or <i>oubliette</i>, of which the late
Lord Lytton thus speaks: ‘How could I help
writing romances, when I had walked, trembling
at my own footsteps, through that long gallery
with its ghostly portraits, mused in these tapestry
chambers, and passed with bristling hair into the
shadowy abysses’ of the secret chamber. This
portion of Knebworth was pulled down in 1812.</p>

<p>Referring to houses north of the Border having
secret chambers, Sir Walter Scott says: ‘There
were few Scottish houses belonging to families
of rank which had not such contrivances, the
political incidents of the times often calling
them into occupation.’ ‘The concealed apartment
opening by a sliding panel into the parlour,’
in the old mansion-house of Swinton, is
made good use of by Sir Walter in his beautiful
novel of <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>.</p>

<p>Some ten or twelve years ago, while workmen
were employed in making alterations at the
house of Nunraw, near the village of Garvald,
Haddingtonshire, they came upon a secret
chamber in the depth of one of the walls,
which on inspection was found to contain some
mummies, pictures, and other property. In olden
times, Nunraw was a nunnery belonging to the
priory of Haddington, and though modernised,
still exhibits evident marks of great antiquity.</p>

<p>There is an apartment now used as a bedroom
in Sir George Warrender’s house at Bruntsfield,
near Edinburgh, which, however, can hardly be
called a secret chamber, inasmuch as it possesses
windows and two external walls, but having the
interior walls on both sides of the entrance of
great thickness. The history of this room is
somewhat obscure. It is said to have been used
as a place of concealment for certain Jacobites
after the rebellion of 1745; and blood-stains, which
are still distinctly visible on the floor, point
remotely to this theory. Another story is that
a cadet of the house of Warrender returned from
Carlisle about 1760, and shortly afterwards died
in this room, which was immediately bricked
up, so that all evidences of the event might be
removed. In any case, the room had remained
sealed up beyond the recollection of any one
familiar with the house, and the ivy with which
the walls were at this time covered, had almost
entirely obliterated any external traces. It was
rediscovered about sixty years ago by Lee, the
English landscape painter, who, when sketching
the house, found himself putting in windows of
which he could not remember the rooms. When
opened, the room presented the appearance of
having been left hurriedly, by a departing guest,
everything being in disorder, even to the ashes
left undisturbed in the grate. Bruntsfield House
dates from 1605.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weeping woman looked up, and beheld the
loveliest face she had ever seen. The girl standing
before her possessed all the attributes of southern
beauty. Her hair, which was long and luxuriant,
hung in one thick plait down her back, and lay
in careless waves upon a forehead pure as chiselled
marble; her face was full, with deep red flushed
under the transparent skin; her features exquisitely
moulded; whilst her eyes, deep as
running water, conveyed an air of pride and
power—a sense of passion equally capable of
looking implacable hate or fondest love. They
were commanding now, as the woman looked up
in the stranger’s face.</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ she asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>‘Men call me Isodore,’ the stranger replied in
a voice singularly sweet. ‘I have no other
name. Will you let me look at the coin you
have in your hand?’</p>

<p>Never dreaming of refusing this request, the
woman handed over the gold piece to the girl,
who looked at it long and intently. Her eyes
were hard and stern when she spoke again.
‘Where did you get this?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘It was given me to stake at the table. I
noticed that it bore some device, and I exchanged
it for a coin of my own.’</p>

<p>‘It has no meaning to you! It is not possible
you are one of us?’</p>

<p>‘I do not understand you,’ the woman replied.
‘It is a curious coin. I have seen one once before—that
is all I know of it.’</p>

<p>‘Listen!’ the girl said in a hushed voice. ‘You
do not comprehend what its possession means to
you. It is the symbol, the sign of membership
of the strongest political Brotherhood in Europe.
If it was known to be in your possession, your
life would pay the forfeit; it would be regained
at all hazards. If one of the Brotherhood knew
another had deliberately parted with it, I would
not give a hair for his life.’</p>

<p>‘And he is in danger of his life!’ the woman
cried, starting to her feet. ‘Give it me, that I
may return it to him.’</p>

<p>‘No!’ was the stern reply; ‘he does not get
off so easily. We do not temper the wind thus
to traitors.—Woman! what is Hector le Gautier
to you, that you should do this favour for
him?’</p>

<p>‘He is a man, and his life is in danger. It is
my duty’——</p>

<p>‘Mark me!’ Isodore replied with stern emphasis.
‘I have not the eyes of a hawk and the
hearing of a hare for nothing. I was opposite
you in the saloon, and I know that something
more than womanly sympathy prompts you. I
saw the struggle in Le Gautier’s face; I saw you
start and tremble as he spoke to you; I saw you
change the coin for one of yours, and I saw you
weeping over it just now. Woman! I ask again
what is he to you?’</p>

<p>Slowly the words came from the other’s lips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">{645}</span>
as if forced from them by some mesmeric influence.
‘You are right,’ she said; ‘for—heaven
help me—he is my husband! I am Valerie le
Gautier.—Now, tell me who you are.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me something more. How long has he
been your husband?’</p>

<p>‘Nine years—nine long, weary years of coldness
and neglect, hard words, and, to my shame,
hard blows. But he tired of me, as he tires of
all his toys; he always tires when the novelty
wears off.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Isodore said softly, ‘as he tired of
me.’</p>

<p>‘You!’ exclaimed Valerie le Gautier, starting—‘you!
What! and have you, too, fallen a
victim to his treachery? If you have known
him, been a victim to his perfidy, then, from
the bottom of my heart, I pity you.’</p>

<p>‘And I need pity.’</p>

<p>For a short space neither spoke, as they sat
listening to the murmur of the leaves in the trees,
broken every now and then by the sounds of play
or laughter within the glittering saloon. Isodore’s
face, sad and downcast for a moment, gradually
resumed its hard, proud look, and when she spoke
again, she was herself.</p>

<p>‘We have a sympathy in common,’ she said.
‘We have a debt to pay, and, by your help, I will
pay it. Justice, retribution is slow, but it is
certain. Tell me, Valerie—if I may call you by
your name—how long is it since you saw your
husband till to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Seven years—seven years since he deserted
me cruelly and heartlessly, leaving me penniless
in the streets of Rome. I had to live how I
could; I even begged sometimes, for he has
squandered the little money I brought to him.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think he knew you to-night?’ Isodore
asked.</p>

<p>‘Knew me?’ was the bitter response. ‘No,
indeed. Had he known I was so near, he would
have fled from my presence.’</p>

<p>‘He laughs at us, no doubt, as poor defenceless
women. But time will show. I can ever
find an hour in the midst of my great work to
watch his movements. I have waited long; but
the day is coming now.—Would you know the
latest ambition of your honourable husband?
He intends to get married again. He has dared
to lift his eyes to Enid Charteris.’</p>

<p>‘Hector dares to marry again!’ Valerie exclaimed,
‘and I alive? Oh, I must take vengeance,
indeed, for this.’</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, shutting her lips
tightly. The passion of jealousy, long crushed
down, rose with overwhelming force; she was
no longer a weak defenceless woman, but a
fury, maddened and goaded to the last extremity.</p>

<p>Isodore watched her, well pleased with this display
of spirit. ‘Now you speak,’ she said admiringly,
‘and I respect you. All your womanhood
is on fire within you to avenge the wrongs of
years, and it shall be no fault of mine if they
slumber again. Yes, your perfect husband designs
to wed again.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you are a witch. You have roused
my curiosity; you must tell me more than
this.’</p>

<p>‘Hector le Gautier is in love,’ Isodore replied,
a world of quiet scorn running through her
words, ‘and, strange as it may seem, I believe
true. An English girl—Enid Charteris, with
the blue eyes and fair hair—has bewitched him,
satiated as he is with southern beauty.—You
look surprised! I have the gift of fern-seed,
and walk invisible. All these things I know.
The Order is to be betrayed when the pear is
ripe, and the traitor will be Hector le Gautier.
The price of his treachery will enable him to
become respectable, and lead a quiet life henceforward
with his loving fair-haired bride. Poor,
feeble, calculating fool!’ The bitter scorn in
these words was undescribable, and round the
speaker’s lips a smile was wreathed—a smile of
placid unrelenting hate and triumph strangely
blended.</p>

<p>‘It shall never be,’ Valerie cried passionately,
‘while I can raise my voice to save an innocent
girl from the toils of such a scoundrel!—Yes,’
she hissed out between her white clenched teeth,
‘it will be a fitting revenge. It would be bliss
indeed to me if I could stand between them
at the altar, and say that man is mine!’</p>

<p>‘He is ours,’ Isodore corrected sternly; ‘do
not ignore that debt entirely. Be content to
leave the plot to me. I have worked out my
scheme, and we shall not fail. Five years ago,
I was a child, happy on the banks of my
beloved Tiber. It was not far from Rome
that we lived, my old nurse and I, always
happy till he came and stole away my heart
with his grand promises and sweet words. Six
short months sufficed him, for I was only a
child then, and he threw away his broken plaything.
It made a woman of me, and it cost me
a lover worth a world of men like him. I told
him I would have revenge. He laughed then;
but the time is coming surely. I have a powerful
interest in the Brotherhood; he knows me
by name, but otherwise we are strangers. To-night,
I saw my old lover in his company. Ah,
had he but known!—Come, Valerie; give me
that coin, the lucky piece of gold which shall
lure him to destruction. Come with me; I
must say more to you.’</p>

<p>Mechanically, Valerie le Gautier followed her
companion out of the Kursaal gardens, through
the streets, walking till they got a little way out
of the town. At a house there, a little back
from the road, Isodore stopped, and opened the
door with a passkey. Inside, all was darkness;
but taking her friend by the hand, and bidding
her not to fear, Isodore led her forward along a
flagged passage and up a short flight of steps.
Opening another door, and turning up the hanging
lamp, she smiled. ‘Sit down,’ she said, ‘my
sister that is to be. You are welcome.’</p>

<p>The apartment was somewhat large and lofty.
By the light from the silver lamp, suspended from
the ceiling in an eagle’s beak, the stranger noticed
the room with its satin-wood panels running half
way up the walls, surmounted by crimson silk
hangings, divided over the three long windows
by gold cords; a thread of the same material
running through the rich upholstery with which
the place was garnished. The floor was paved
with bright coloured woodwork of some mysterious
design; and heavy rugs, thick and soft to
the feet, scattered about sufficient for comfort, but
not enough to mar the beauty of the inlaid floor.
Pictures on china plates let into the hangings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">{646}</span>
were upon the walls; and in the windows were
miniature ferneries, a little fountain plashing
in the midst of each. There was no table in
the room, nothing whereon to deposit anything,
save three brass stands, high and narrow; one
a little larger than the rest, upon which stood
a silver spirit-lamp under a quaint-looking urn,
a chocolate pot to match, and three china cups.
There were cosy-looking chairs of dark massive
oak, upholstered in red silk, with the same gold
thread interwoven in all. A marble clock, with
a figure of Liberty thereon, stood on the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>Isodore threw herself down in a chair. The
other woman took in the scene with speechless
rapture; there was something soothing in the
harmonious place. ‘You are pleased,’ Isodore
said with a little smile of pleasure, as she surveyed
the place. ‘This is my home, if I can
call any place a home for such a wanderer;
but when I can steal a few days from the cares
of the cause, I come here. I need not ask
you if you like my apartments?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, I do,’ Valerie replied, drawing a long
breath of delight. ‘It is absolutely perfect. The
whole thing surprises and bewilders me. I should
not have thought there had been such a place
in Homburg.’</p>

<p>‘I will give you another surprise,’ Isodore
laughed, ‘before the evening is over. I am the
princess of surprises; I surprise even the followers
who owe me loyal submission.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! had I such a paradise as this, I should
forswear political intrigue. I should leave that
to those who had more to gain or to lose by such
hazards. I should be content to let the world go
on, so that I had my little paradise.’</p>

<p>‘So I feel at times,’ Isodore observed with
a little sigh. ‘But I am too deeply pledged
to draw my hand back now. Without me, the
Order is like an army deprived of its general;
besides, I am the creature of circumstance; I
am the sworn disciple of those whose mission
it is to free the down-trodden from oppression
and to labour in freedom’s name.’ As she said
these words, the sad look upon her brow cleared
away like mist before the sun, and a proud
light glistened in the wondrous eyes. Half
ashamed of her enthusiasm, she turned to the
stand by her side, and soon two cups of chocolate
were frothed out of the pot, filling the room
with its fragrance. Crossing the floor, she handed
one of the cups to her new-found friend. For
a moment they sat silent, then Isodore turned
to her companion smilingly.</p>

<p>‘How would you like to go with me to
London?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘I would follow you to the world’s end!’
was the fervid reply; ‘but there are many difficulties
in the way. I have my own living to
get, precarious as it is, and I dare not leave
this place.’</p>

<p>‘I permit no difficulties to stand in my way,’
Isodore said proudly; ‘to say a thing, with me,
is to do it. Let me be candid with you, Valerie.
Providence has thrown you in my path, and
you will be useful to me; in addition, I have
taken a fancy to you. Yes,’ she continued fervently,
‘the time has come—the pear is ripe.
You shall come with me to London; you have a
wrong as well as I, and you shall see the height
of Isodore’s vengeance.’ Saying these words in a
voice quivering with passionate intensity, she
struck three times on the bell at her side. Immediately,
in answer to this, the heavy curtains
over the door parted, and a girl entered.</p>

<p>She was Isodore’s living image; the same style
and passionate type of face; but she lacked the
other’s firm determined mouth and haughtiness
of features. She was what the lily is to the
passion-flower. Her eyes were bent upon her
sister—for she was Lucrece—with the same love
and patient devotion one sees in the face of a
dog.</p>

<p>‘You rang, Isodore?’ she asked; and again
the stranger noticed the great likeness in the
voice, save as to the depth and ring of Isodore’s
tones.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Lucrece, I rang,’ the sister replied. ‘I
have brought a visitor to see you.—Lucrece, this
lady is Hector le Gautier’s wife.’</p>

<p>‘Le Gautier’s wife?’ the girl asked with
startled face. ‘Then what brings her here? I
should not have expected’——</p>

<p>‘You interrupt me, child, in the midst of my
explanations. I should have said Le Gautier’s
deserted wife.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ Lucrece exclaimed, ‘I understand.—Isodore,
if you collect under your roof all the
women he has wronged and deceived, you will
have a large circle. What is she worth to us?’</p>

<p>‘Child!’ Isodore returned with some marked
emphasis on her words, ‘she is my friend—the
friend of Isodore should need no welcome
here.’</p>

<p>A deep blush spread over the features of
Lucrece at these words, as she walked across the
room to Valerie’s side. Her smile was one of
consolation and welcome as she stooped and
kissed the other woman lightly. ‘Welcome!’
she said. ‘We see both friends and foes here,
and it is hard sometimes to tell the grain from
the chaff. You are henceforward the friend of
Lucrece too.’</p>

<p>‘Your kindness almost hurts me,’ Valerie replied
in some agitation. ‘I have so few friends, that
a word of sympathy is strange to me. Whatever
you may want or desire, either of you, command
me, and Valerie le Gautier will not say you
nay.’</p>

<p>‘Lucrece, listen to me,’ said Isodore in a voice
of stern command. ‘To-morrow, we cross to
London, and the time has come when you must
be prepared to assist in the cause.—See what I
have here!’ Without another word, she placed
the gold moidore in her sister’s hand.</p>

<p>Lucrece regarded it with a puzzled air. To
her simple mind, it merely represented the badge
of the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>‘You do not understand,’ Isodore continued,
noticing the look of bewilderment. ‘That coin,
as you know, is the token of the Order, and to
part with it knowingly is serious’——</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Lucrece interrupted; ‘the penalty is
death.’</p>

<p>‘You are right, my sister. That is Le Gautier’s
token. He staked it yonder at the Kursaal,
giving it to his own wife, though he did not
know it, to put upon the colour. The coin is in
my hands, as you see. Strange, how man becomes
fortune’s fool!’</p>

<p>‘Then your revenge will be complete,’ Lucrece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">{647}</span>
suggested simply. ‘You have only to hand it
over to the Council of Three, or even the
Crimson Nine, and in one hour’——</p>

<p>‘A dagger’s thrust will rid the world of a
scoundrel.—Pah! you do not seem to understand
such feeling as mine. No, no; I have another
punishment for him. He shall live; he shall
carry on his mad passion for the fair-haired Enid
till the last; and when his cup of joy shall seem
full, I will dash it from his lips.’</p>

<p>‘Your hate is horrible,’ Valerie exclaimed with
an involuntary shudder. ‘I should not like to
cross your path.’</p>

<p>‘My friends find me true,’ Isodore answered
sadly; ‘it is only my enemies that feel the
weight of my arm.—But enough of this; we
need stout hearts and ready brains, for we have
much work before us.’</p>

<p>Three days later, and the women drove through
the roar and turmoil of London streets. They
were bent upon duty and revenge. One man in
that vast city of four or five million souls was
their quarry.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Mr Varley, Sir Geoffrey Charteris’ valet and
factotum, and majordomo in the baronet’s town
residence, Grosvenor Square, was by no means
devoid of courage; but the contents of the note
he was reading in the hall one fine morning early
in May were sufficient to put to flight for the
moment any vengeful schemes he was harbouring
against the wily gentleman who has just
quitted the house, and that gentleman no less a
person than our old friend Le Gautier.</p>

<p>Timothy Varley was an Irishman, and had
been in his youth what is termed a patriot. In
his hot blood he had even joined a League for
the ‘removal of tyrants;’ but the League, in
spite of its solemn form and binding oaths, had
died a natural death. At times, however, the
recollection of it troubled Mr Varley’s conscience
sorely. It was destined to be brought to his mind
now in a startling manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘G. S. I. You will be at the corner of Chapel
Place to-night at nine. A girl will meet you,
and show you the way. You are wanted; your
turn has come. Do not fail.—<span class="smcap">Number XI.</span>’</p>
</div>

<p>Never did Bob Acres, in that celebrated comedy,
<i>The Rivals</i>, feel the courage oozing from his
finger-tips as did Timothy Varley now. He
turned the missive over in his fingers; but no
consolation was to be derived from that; and
bitterly did he revile the juvenile folly that had
placed him in such a position at this time of
life.</p>

<p>‘It is no sham,’ he muttered to himself. ‘God
save Ireland—that is the old countersign; and
to think of it turning up now! I had forgotten
the thing years ago. This comes of joining secret
societies—a nice thing to bring a respectable
family man to! Now, by the powers! who was
Number Eleven? That used to be Pat Mahoney;
and a mighty masterful man he was, always ready
with his hands if anything crossed him. O dear,
O dear! this is a pretty thing. Maybe they
want to mix me up with dynamite; but if they
do, I won’t do it, and that’s flat. I suppose I
shall have to go.’</p>

<p>Giving vent to these words in a doleful tone
of voice, he betook himself to his private sanctum.
His spirits were remarked to be the reverse of
cheerful, and he declined a glass of sherry at
lunch, a thing which roused much speculation
below stairs.</p>

<p>Punctual to the moment, Timothy Varley
stood in Chapel Place waiting for his unknown
guide. Just as he was beginning to imagine the
affair to be a hoax, and congratulating himself
thereon, a woman passed him, stopped, and
walked in his direction again. ‘God save
Ireland!’ she said as she repassed.</p>

<p>‘Amen, not forgetting one Timothy Varley,’ he
returned piously.</p>

<p>‘It is well,’ the woman replied calmly, ‘that
you are here. Follow me!’</p>

<p>‘With the greatest of pleasure.—But hark
here; my legs are not so young as yours: if we
are going far, let us have a cab, and I’ll stand
the damage.’</p>

<p>‘There is no occasion,’ the stranger said in a
singularly sweet voice. ‘We have not a great
distance to travel.’</p>

<p>‘Not good enough to ride in the same carriage
with a gentleman’s gentleman,’ Varley muttered,
for he did not fail to note the stranger’s refined
tones.</p>

<p>His guide led him along Tottenham Court
Road, and thence to Fitzroy Square. Turning
into a little side-street, she reached at length a
door, at which she knocked.</p>

<p>In a room on the first floor, Isodore and Valerie
le Gautier were seated, waiting the advent of
Lucrece and the stranger. Varley began to feel
bewildered in the presence of so much beauty
and grace; for Isodore’s loveliness overpowered
him, as it did all men with whom she came
in contact. Scarcely deigning to notice his presence,
she motioned him to a chair, where he
sat the picture of discomfiture, all traces of the
audacious Irishman having disappeared.</p>

<p>‘Your name is Timothy Varley?’ Isodore
said.</p>

<p>‘Yes, miss; leastways, it was when I came
here, though, if you were to tell me I was the
man in the moon, I couldn’t say nay to you.’</p>

<p>‘I know you,’ Isodore continued. ‘You were
born near Mallow, joined the United Brotherhood
thirty years ago, and your Number was
Twenty-six. If I am wrong, you will please
correct me.’</p>

<p>‘For goodness’ sake, miss—my lady, I mean—don’t
speak so loud. Think what might happen
to me if any one knew!’</p>

<p>‘No wonder your countrymen fail, with such
chicken-hearts among them,’ Isodore observed
scornfully. ‘I do not want to do you any
harm; quite the contrary. There is an advertisement
in to-day’s <i>Times</i>. Your mistress is in
search of a maid. Is that so?’</p>

<p>Timothy Varley began to breathe a little more
freely. ‘Yes,’ he answered glibly; ‘she does
want a maid. She must be honest, sober, and
industrious; ready to sit up all night if necessary,
and have a good temper—not that Miss
Enid will try any one’s temper much. The last
girl was discharged’——</p>

<p>‘Now, Mr Varley, I know a girl who must
fill that vacancy. I do not wish to threaten
you or hold any rod of terror over your head;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">{648}</span>
but I shall depend upon you to procure it for
my protégée.’</p>

<p>The conversation apparently was not going to
be so pleasant. Timothy Varley’s mind turned
feebly in the direction of diamond robberies.</p>

<p>‘Well, miss—that is, my lady—if I may make
so bold as to ask you a question: why, if the
matter is so simple, don’t you write to my young
mistress and settle the matter that way?’</p>

<p>‘Impossible,’ Isodore replied, ‘for reasons I
cannot enter into with you. You must do what
I ask, and that speedily.—You have a certain
Monsieur le Gautier at your house often?’</p>

<p>This question was so abruptly asked, that
Varley could not repress a start. ‘We have,’
he growled—‘a good deal too often, to please
me. My master dare not call his body his own
since he first began to come to the house with
his signs and manifestations.—You see,’ he explained,
‘servants are bound to hear these
things.’</p>

<p>‘At keyholes and such places,’ Isodore smiled.
‘Yes, I understand such things do happen occasionally.
So this Le Gautier is a spiritualist,
is he; and Sir Geoffrey is his convert?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you may say that,’ Varley burst out
in tones of great grievance. ‘The baronet sees
visions and all sorts of things.’</p>

<p>‘Is it possible,’ Valerie whispered to her friend,
‘that Hector has really succeeded in gaining
an influence over this Sir Geoffrey by those
miserable tricks he played so successfully at
Rome?’</p>

<p>‘It is very probable,’ Isodore murmured in
reply. ‘This Sir Geoffrey is very weak in intellect.—Tell
me, Mr Varley,’ she continued, turning
in his direction, ‘does the baronet keep much
of Monsieur le Gautier’s company? Does he
visit at his rooms?’</p>

<p>‘I believe he does; anyway, he goes out
at nights, and always comes back looking as if
he had seen a ghost. Whatever his game may
be—and sure enough there is some game on—it’s
killing him by inches, that’s what it’s
doing.’</p>

<p>‘And this change you put down to Le Gautier?
Perhaps you are right. And now, another question.
Is not there another reason, another attraction
besides discussing spiritualism with Sir
Geoffrey, that takes him to Grosvenor Square?’</p>

<p>Varley so far forgot himself as to wink impressively.
‘You might have made a worse guess
than that,’ he said. ‘I am not the only one
who can see what his designs are. Miss Enid
is the great attraction.’</p>

<p>‘And she?’</p>

<p>‘Hates him, if looks count for anything.—And
so do I,’ he continued; ‘and so do all of us, for
the matter of that. I would give a year’s salary
to see his back turned for good!’</p>

<p>‘Mr Varley,’ Isodore said in grave tones, ‘I
sent for you here to work upon your fears, and to
compel you, if necessary, to do my bidding. That,
I see, is not necessary, for we have a common
bond of sympathy. For reasons I need not state
here, we have good reasons for keeping a watch
over this Le Gautier; but rest assured of one
thing—that he will never wed your mistress.
I shall hold you to secrecy.—And now, you must
promise to get my protégée this situation.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I will do my best,’ Varley replied
cheerfully. ‘But how it is going to be done,
I really can’t see.’</p>

<p>‘Irishmen are proverbial for their inventive
powers, and doubtless you will discover a way.—The
new maid is a French girl, remember, the
daughter of an old friend. Perhaps you would
like to see her?’ With a gesture she indicated
Lucrece, who came forward, turning to the Irishman
with one of her most dazzling smiles. The
feeling of bewilderment came on again.</p>

<p>‘She!’ he cried; ‘that beautiful young lady
a servant?’</p>

<p>‘When she is plainly dressed, as suitable to
her lowly station, she will appear different.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you may pull the leaves from the flowers,
but the beauty remains to them still,’ Varley
replied, waxing poetical. ‘However, if it must
be, it must; so I will do my best.’</p>

<p>Varley’s diplomacy proved successful, for, a
week later, Lucrece was installed at Grosvenor
Square.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="MINERAL_SUBSIDENCE">MINERAL SUBSIDENCE.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> alarming subsidence which took place some
time ago in Scotland, on the North British
Railway near Prestonpans, and which was fortunately
unattended with any accident, has doubtless
added a fresh source of fear to the nervous
railway passenger. That the permanent way of a
railway for a distance of about fifty yards should
suddenly sink to the extent of two feet is almost
incomprehensible at first; and had this subsidence
occurred whilst the train was passing,
instead of immediately afterwards, the consequences
might have been disastrous. It is the
case, however, though it may not be generally
known, that subsidences—fortunately only
gradual, and comparatively inappreciable—are
taking place over many of our railway lines,
and that ‘minerals’ are actually being extracted
from underneath nearly every line of railway
under which there is any mineral to get.</p>

<p>The damage done to the line at Prestonpans
was reported to have been caused by coal-workings
which were there long before the railway
was laid; but if it was caused by them at all,
it was on account of their being influenced by
the working of a seam of coal below them, which
was going on at the time the subsidence occurred.
It is the fact, however, that when a Railway
Company acquires ground under its parliamentary
powers, the minerals underneath the ground do not
pass along with it. This may seem a little surprising
at first; but it is not so when it is considered
that very frequently the proprietor of the surface
of the ground and the proprietor of the minerals
underneath it are different persons. Of course
the proprietor of an estate under no reservations
is proprietor as high as he can get and as deep
as he cares to go; but he may sell or lease the
minerals and retain the surface, or <i>vice versâ</i>.
Thus it is that a Railway Company has only,
as it were, a right of passage over the surface;
and that its right goes no deeper, except for the
construction or up-keep of its lines. By Act of
Parliament, however, the proprietor of minerals
below any railway line, before proceeding to
work them, must give notice to the Railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">{649}</span>
Company of his intention to do so, so as to give
the Company an opportunity of buying him off,
should it feel disposed. If it does not declare
its option to purchase the minerals, the workings
proceed, and the railway has to take its
chance. The mineral owner will, however, be
held liable, should any damage occur owing to
improper working.</p>

<p>The subsidence of a railway line underneath
which the minerals have been worked is as a
rule very gradual, and extends over some length
of time. Many railway passengers must have
noticed the walls of waiting-rooms disfigured by
ungainly cracks, the stone lintels displaced, the
hearthstones awry, and many other signs, which
are caused by the working of minerals underneath.
Some station-masters can show you on the stone
face of the platform the number of inches the
line has sunk. As a matter of fact, were it not
for the gangs of surfacemen the Railway Companies
employ to watch any irregularities in their
lines, in a very short space of time the permanent
way would in many places probably represent
something like the proposed line of the Undulating
Railway, a fantastical scheme of long ago.
The railway in Ayrshire which runs over the
old workings of the famous Wishaw coal-seam,
especially suffers in the way of subsidence;
and some parts of the railway in the west of
Fife are known to have gradually sunk to an
extent of over ten feet.</p>

<p>But railway lines are not the only parts of
the surface which are subsiding owing to the
working of minerals. The whole surface of the
land surrounding the many pits and mines which
are continually belching forth their wagon-loads
of coal or other mineral, is gradually subsiding
as the extraction of the mineral proceeds; and
damage amounting to thousands of pounds is
annually being done to the surface and the buildings
on it owing to mineral workings. As the
period and extent of the subsidence and the
damage following on it depend greatly on the
method employed in working the coal, a word
or two here on this subject may not be out of
place.</p>

<p>There are two recognised methods of working
out coal. The old method is what is known as
the ‘stoop-and-room’ or ‘pillar-and-room’ system;
and the method introduced into Scotland about
the beginning of the present century is known
as the ‘longwall’ or ‘Shropshire’ system of
working. The first system explains itself by its
name. After the bed of coal is struck, ‘rooms’
are worked out, leaving ‘pillars’ or ‘stoops’ to
support the superincumbent strata. The object
to be attained in this system, as practised in the
olden times, was to have as large a room worked
out, and as small a stoop or pillar of the coal
itself left, as was consistent with the safety of
the mine and the support of the surface, while
the mine was open. But this system entailed the
entire loss of the pillars so left. To obviate
this loss, the method now generally adopted is to
drive narrow rooms or passages, seldom exceeding
fourteen feet, through the seam, leaving large
pillars—about seventy-five per cent. of the mineral—until
the extremity of the available coal is
reached. When, however, no regard is to be had
for the surface, and the coal has been thus worked
out as far as can be done, the miner commences
to work backwards, taking out the stoops or
pillars as he goes. The whole roof of the mine
then comes down; and this is the most dangerous
kind of subsidence. It does not only take effect
immediately above the place where ‘stooping’
has been going on, but it also ‘draws’ round
about it.</p>

<p>The ‘longwall’ or Shropshire method of working
is what is known as the system of complete
excavation; that is, the miner takes out the
whole coal as he proceeds, leaving only perhaps
a foot on the roof, should the overlying
strata be soft, and props up a passage with
wooden supports as he proceeds, to enable
him to keep an open way to the face of the
coal. The portions worked out are packed
on each side of the ‘road’ with the waste
material taken out with the coal. This method
of working, though it necessarily implies subsidence,
is on the whole the safest for the
surface, and is generally the one adopted. In
fact, as mineral landlords are paid, in lieu of
rent, a royalty or lordship on every ton of coal
or other mineral brought to the surface, and as
the tenant can more quickly extract the mineral
by the wooden props method, he is generally
bound in his lease to work in this manner, when
practicable.</p>

<p>Should the coal be worked on the stoop-and-room
system, and pillars of coal of sufficient size
be left in, the surface will not be injured to any
appreciable extent, at least not for many years.
As is often the case, however, seams of coal are
worked out one below the other; and when the
lower one gives way, the pillars above may fall
like a pack of cards. There is no saying where
the subsidence would reach in such a case. If
the pillars do not break, the way in which the
‘rooms’ close up, if the floor is soft, is rather
peculiar. The roof does not all fall in, as would
be expected; but the enormous weight of the
superincumbent strata pressing on the pillars
causes the floor between them to rise up or
‘creep,’ and the room becomes closed. On the
other hand, if the stoops of coal are taken out,
the roof comes down with a crash, and the effects
on the surface may be disastrous; but of course
it sometimes pays better to get out all the coal
and let the surface go, than to allow the workings
to get closed up and the coal in the pillars
to be lost for ever.</p>

<p>The subsidence following on a ‘longwall’ working
is gradual, but sure. The surface is not
broken to any great extent, but comes down in
one sheet, and not irregularly, as in stoop-and-room
workings. The strata generally come to rest in
about three or four years. A row of houses which
have been cracked through and through on the
subsidence reaching the surface, have been known
to close up again when the strata have settled.</p>

<p>The damage done by pillar-and-room workings
is irregular both as regards effect and time. It
may commence, stop, and commence again.
Houses are literally wrecked by it. So palpable
is it, indeed, that actually the sound of the
crushing and subsiding of the house can be
distinctly heard. The slates are twisted off the
roof, the chimneys hang in all directions, the
walls are rent asunder, the foundations give
way, and the house is rendered uninhabitable.
An instance of this is to be found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">{650}</span>
salt-workings of Cheshire, in the neighbourhood
of which, houses are constantly being wrecked.
Thousands of pounds are paid every year by
mine-owners for damages done to surface proprietors,
farmers, and others; and there is no
more fruitful source of litigation than surface-damage.</p>

<p>Even under public roads, we find the minerals
being worked. The public have only a right
of passage, the minerals underneath belonging to
the adjoining proprietor, and it is not an uncommon
circumstance in mining districts for a
road to suddenly sink several feet.</p>

<p>In the case of a proprietor of minerals in lands
adjoining the sea, his right, as a general rule,
extends only to high-water mark. Below that
line, underneath the foreshore and the sea itself,
the minerals belong to the Crown. The Crown,
of course, can lease the minerals, and they
are very frequently worked under the sea itself.
In such a case, great precautions have to be
observed in the workings, to prevent any chance
of the sea breaking in, though, when the stratum
above is rock, the mineral is sometimes worked
out within a very few feet of the bottom of the
sea! In some mines, the roar of the ocean
above can be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>This, however, is a digression from the subject
of subsidence. Subsidence of the surface above
our almost inexhaustible beds of coal has been
going on, and will go on more or less, until
that day in the dim futurity which has been
foretold, when our coal-seams will have become
exhausted, but when, let us hope, the inventive
genius of posterity will have discovered another
fuel, or done away with the necessity of fuel
altogether.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.—LOVE’S YOUNG DREAM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a few days Anne Porteous felt rather miserable.
She was angry with herself for her imprudence
in allowing such a misfortune to have
happened; her feminine vanity was not in the
least bit tickled at having the refusal of the
famous editor, for she was not at all of that
class of savage females who gloat over the roll
of their rejected suitors as a Red Indian does
over his string of scalps. No; she felt really
and truly vexed for her old and kind friend,
though, with the inconsistency of her sex, she
could not but feel just the least bit piqued that,
seeing he had cared for her so much as to ask
her to be his wife, he had taken her unavoidable
refusal so calmly and in such good part. She
was glad to find, however, he had not forgotten
her altogether; although he was now at Lucerne,
she got the <i>Olympic</i> and other London magazines
addressed to her in his familiar splashy handwriting,
just as before. But there were no letters
now. Formerly, she used to act as correspondent
between him and her father, whose fingers were
too stiff from rheumatism to make writing convenient.
She missed the gay cheerful letters,
with their satirical sketches of the lions of the
circles he moved in, and their playful banter
of herself even. However, one day the postman
brought a letter which turned her thoughts into
an entirely different channel. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, 19th <i>Sept.</i> 188-.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My darling Nan</span>—I have just time to write
this before starting for London by the tidal
train. Old Uncle Joseph is dead. I have just
got the telegram announcing the event, which
took place this morning. I hope he will have
left me a good round sum, so that I can start
practice at once, and then a certain young lady
I know of will not be long of coming to keep
house for me. With a thousand kisses.—Yours
ever,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Alfred Roberton.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>She mused over this letter for a few minutes;
something in it jarred on her feelings. She did
not quite like the matter-of-fact way in which
the writer announced the death of his uncle,
to whom he was entirely indebted for his upbringing
and education. Nor was she quite
pleased at the assured way he spoke of a ‘certain
young lady’ coming to keep house for him.
Why, as yet he had not even seen her father—not
to speak of his having got no consent to
their union. Nan was a pre-eminently practical
young woman; but a kind, loving, faithful heart
beat in her bosom, and it resented the tone of
the note as being callous and far too self-assured.
Of course, it was written under a
pressure for time; but still it might have contained
some little expression of sorrow for the
death of one who had done so much for him,
instead of hoping for a good legacy.</p>

<p>Alfred Roberton was her engaged lover. She
met him at a dancing party given by a mutual
friend in le Quartier l’Anglais, Brussels. He
was possessed of a stalwart handsome figure, and
an agreeable face and voice. That he was clever,
might possibly be inferred from the fact that
he had carried off quite a number of college
honours. That he thought himself clever, didn’t
require to be inferred from anything—it was
stamped on his face, and showed itself in his
every look and gesture. Whether Anne saw
this, we know not; if she did, it was insufficient
to prevent her falling deeply in love
with him. A few moonlight strolls under
the linden trees, a few soft pressures of the
hand, a few sighs and tender speeches, and
practical, sober-minded Anne gave her whole
heart to this handsome youth—the first who
had ever addressed her in the magic accents
of love. And he? Well, he loved truly and
sincerely enough in his own sort of way, just
as he had loved other young ladies before. He
was one of those men who seem to hold a
power of fascination over the other sex. He
did not mean to be a flirt—but how could he
help the girls falling in love with him? He
couldn’t make a brute of himself, and be rude
and insolent to them—could he? His conquests
were, however, usually of brief duration; for some
reason or other not known, his previous love
affairs had come to an untimely end. It
was generally thought by his friends—and himself
too—that his love for Anne was sincere
and genuine, and could end in nothing else
than matrimony. His uncle’s demise would
bring matters to a crisis. He had adopted him
at an early age, being himself a childless widower.
Mr Joseph Roberton was a Scotchman, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">{651}</span>
gone early in life to push his fortune in the
great Metropolis. Starting business after a while
as a cheesemonger, he had in the course of years
managed to scrape together quite a little fortune;
and when his brother died, he gladly adopted
his only son Alfred, and gave him a first-class
education. When he arrived at an age for
choosing a business or profession, he expressed
a desire to be a doctor, so his uncle sent him
to Edinburgh University, where, in due course
of time, he received his diploma of M.D. While
he was engaged pursuing his medical studies, his
uncle took it into his head to marry his housekeeper,
Mrs Janet Grant. Alfred did not like
this change in the old gentleman’s domestic
arrangements, for, truth to say, there was little
love lost between him and the late housekeeper;
but any unpleasant feeling he might have felt
in the matter was changed into unmitigated
disgust by the advent of a baby-cousin—his
uncle’s son and heir. The old gentleman was
of course delighted at this addition to his family;
but it did not make any difference in his treatment
of his nephew. He still gave him an
allowance of three hundred pounds a year; and
as he had now got his professional degree, it
was arranged that he should travel on the continent
for a year, visiting the various centres of
medical science, and making himself acquainted
with the latest discoveries, before beginning practice
in London. It was while on this tour that
he met Anne Porteous.</p>

<p>About a week after receiving her lover’s letter,
a tall, gentlemanly looking stranger entered the
coffee-room of Lochenbreck Inn, and, much to
the waiting-maid’s surprise, asked to see Miss
Porteous. Anne did not need to look at the
stranger’s card; she knew instinctively it was
her lover, and there being no one else in the
room, she went to meet him. The first fond
greetings over, she saw there was something on
his mind, and that not of a pleasant nature.
She was not long kept in suspense.</p>

<p>‘Do you know, Nan, I have been swindled—thoroughly
swindled? After my uncle’s funeral,
I waited to hear the will read, of course. The
family lawyer was there; and he said there was
no will. His client, he said, had been talking
some time ago of making one, and had even given
him some general directions about it; but he says
it was never executed, and that the scheming old
housekeeper and her brat are heirs to all. Isn’t
it shameful?’</p>

<p>‘Well, Alfred dear,’ Anne replied in a consolatory
tone, ‘you know they were nearer to
him than you could ever be, and you mustn’t
grudge them taking what is justly their own.
Besides, remember how kind your uncle was to
you in his lifetime. Look at what a lot of money
he spent on your education and in fitting you for
a profession.—But did your aunt give you nothing—not
even a remembrance of your uncle?’</p>

<p>‘Well, yes,’ he grumblingly rejoined; ‘she gave
me a cheque for a hundred guineas, and had the
impudence to tell me she never wanted to see
my face again.’</p>

<p>‘And you took it?’</p>

<p>‘Why, yes. Why shouldn’t I?’</p>

<p>‘Well, Alfred, if I had been in your place, I
would not have accepted of a gift given in such a
spirit. However, it will be useful when you begin
practice, which I suppose you will be doing at
once now.’</p>

<p>‘Start business as a doctor in London, with
only a hundred pounds to fall back on! Why,
Nan, you’re surely joking. But I forget: girls
don’t understand these matters.’</p>

<p>‘Then, what do you purpose doing?’ she
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my mind is quite made up as to that,’
he said, drawing himself up proudly. ‘I intend
devoting myself to literature.’</p>

<p>‘And throw away all your medical study and
training for nothing,’ she exclaimed. ‘Surely,
that would be folly, Alfred.’</p>

<p>‘There’s no folly about it,’ he answered. ‘Lots
of fellows, without half the education or, I may
say, ability that I possess, make a thousand or
two a year by writing science articles, stories, and
what not for the monthlies. I’m told it’s about
the best paying thing that’s going. And then,
you see, it does not require any capital. You just
jot down your thoughts on a quire of paper, forward
it to an editor, and you get a cheque back
by return of post for twenty or thirty guineas—or
far more, if your name is well known—as mine
will soon be,’ he added confidently.</p>

<p>This piece of news was not very pleasant to
poor Nan. To be a doctor’s wife in a year or two
was an agreeable enough prospect, especially when
she so fondly loved the man. But to enter on
matrimony with no more assured means of living
than the honorariums which fall to the lot of
an ordinary literary hack, was a bleak lookout.
How often had she heard Mr Hannay aver that
not one in a hundred who tried literature as a
profession succeeded in earning a decent living.
True, Alfred must be very clever, from the number
and value of his college prizes; but then, hadn’t
her old friend often said that education had but
little to do with literary success, and that he
had rejected more manuscripts from college-bred
would-be contributors than from any other class.
She did not fear a life of haphazard poverty for
herself; but her woman’s instinct told her that
it would press hardly on Alfred. She was not
blind to the imperfections of his nature; she was
far too clear-headed for that. But she regarded
him from two distinctly different points of view:
from the one, her common-sense showed him in
all his human imperfections and failings; from
the other, or ideal one, he appeared as a being so
far exalted above the common herd of men that to
love and serve him all the days of her life would
be her chiefest joy and happiness. As the stereoscope
projects two different images into one more
seemingly real than either taken singly, so did her
woman’s love commingle these diverse impressions
of her lover into a glorified and lovable whole.
Who on this earth could be to her what he was to
her? Not being of an exacting or jealous nature,
she had never asked herself the question—Did he
love her as she loved him? If she had done so, she
would have smiled in scorn at the very suggestion
of such a mean doubt; for did not she remember
his warm, trembling words of love—his soft sighs
and tender caresses—his declarations of hopeless
despair, if she withheld her heart from him? It
certainly was a pity this abandonment of his profession;
but then, it might only be a temporary
one. He perhaps might find that, clever as he
was, the paths leading to literary success were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">{652}</span>
steeper and less flowery than he imagined. If so,
then, of course, he would start practice, and all
would yet be well. The slight shadow on her
countenance cleared off. She said: ‘Well, Alfred,
you should know best—perhaps you are right.
Come and I’ll take you to our private parlour.
Papa is sitting out in the garden. I must bring
him in and introduce him to you.—He must
know all now,’ she added with a slight tremor.
She had put off the evil day as long as she could;
but further concealment was now impossible.</p>

<p>It was with faltering accents she confessed her
secret to the old gentleman, as she sat down beside
him in the garden arbour. If she had informed
him that Lochenbreck had suddenly run dry, he
could not have been more astonished. Then he
got angry, and made use of some very uncomplimentary
expressions regarding Anne and her
sex in general. But he was a man of sense and
feeling at heart; and when he saw the hot tears
coursing down her cheeks, he checked himself at
once, caressed her, and told her not to make a
fool of herself. He knew Anne’s character too
well to think that he, or any one, could prevent
her permanently from doing anything her heart
was set on, and which her sound moral consciousness
told her was right and justifiable. He, it is
true, had cherished secret hopes that his old
friend Hannay might have taken a fancy for the
girl, and he would have parted with her to him
freely; now he was asked to give her to a man
that he had never yet seen. It was monstrous;
but then girls always do act in a ridiculous and
contrary manner in these matters of love.</p>

<p>‘Well, Nan, I’ll see the lad—there can be no
harm in that; and I’ll not thwart your happiness
if I find him deserving of you.’</p>

<p>Ay, there was the rub. Was he, or almost any
one else in the world, deserving of his Nan?</p>

<p>Seated in the cosy parlour, and the embarrassment
of the unexpected introduction over, Nan
prudently withdrew, leaving the two gentlemen
to feel their way into each other’s acquaintanceship
over a bottle of claret and a box of cigars.
Alfred was a good talker, easy, self-possessed, and
even genial in his style.</p>

<p>He felt no diffidence in proposing for Anne;
true, meantime he was almost impecunious, and
had no established or certain means of living;
but he was a gentleman, well educated and bred,
and, as he inwardly thought, a very eligible son-in-law
for any innkeeper in the land. Anne
was now called in, and blushingly joined in the
conversation. The suitor pressed for an immediate
union. This was, however, decisively negatived
by both father and daughter. Porteous
had been favourably impressed by his proposed
son-in-law; but when he learned that his future
income was to be derivable solely from literary
emoluments, it became him to act in the matter
with great caution, for the sake of his daughter’s
future. If this literary venture was to be gone
into, its success must be thoroughly demonstrated
in actual pounds, shillings, and pence, before the
marriage could take place. Anne thought this
a reasonable stipulation: her lover didn’t. His
pride felt hurt at finding obstacles where he
imagined he had an easy walk over. He had,
however, to pocket his pride and submit to the
inevitable. On these conditions the lovers became
engaged, with the old gentleman’s approval. A
great weight of concealment was now off Anne’s
mind. Her spirits rose, and for a few brief days
the happy pair abandoned themselves to the
innocent delusions and delights of ‘Love’s young
dream.’</p>

<p>Anne was the first to awake to the realities
of life. She was nothing if not practical, and
she soon realised that all this sweet billing and
cooing was but a waste of time. Her knight
must go forth into the tournament of life, gain
his trophies, and then come back to claim her
as his guerdon.</p>

<p>‘Now, Alfred,’ she said one day, ‘I think
it is high time you should put your literary
projects into execution. That, you can’t well do
here. I think you should take a cheap lodging
in Edinburgh, or some place where you would
have the advantage of good reference libraries,
and set to work at once.’</p>

<p>‘True, Nan; I must think of making a start
one of these days.—But you don’t wish me away,
dearest, do you?’ he said in a tender way.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you know well enough I don’t!’ she
returned with the slightest trace of impatience in
her tone. ‘But if we are to get married, it will
not be by your idling your time away here.
You’ll find a hundred pounds won’t keep you
long in a large city; and think in what an
awkward position you would be, if it got done
before you found a regular and profitable market
for your literary work.’</p>

<p>He was forced to admit the soundness of the
advice, which was emphatically indorsed by Mr
Porteous. So, the following day he packed up
his traps; and the evening found him established
in a modest lodging in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh,
which had formerly known him as a
student.</p>

<p>The lovers might have served as a model for
all others so situated, in the regularity and length
of their communications to each other. For fully
a month, Alfred wrote in the brightest of spirits.
He was engaged on a lengthy paper, ‘A Comparative
Analysis of the Literature of Greece
and Rome.’ This was intended for a famous
London quarterly; he would act prudently, however,
and would not commit himself until he
had ascertained the very highest sum obtainable
for it.</p>

<p>This first venture was completed and posted.
In a few days the manuscript was returned with
a polite note from the editor. The paper, he
admitted, was well written, although not containing
any particularly new views on the subject;
and at anyrate there was no demand for
classic literature on the part of the reading
public at present: therefore, he was under the
necessity of declining it with thanks, &amp;c. He
sent it to some other magazines; but the result
in substance was the same. He was surprised
and disappointed, of course; but buoyed up by
his own self-esteem and Anne’s kind sympathetic
letters, he determined to make a new venture on
different lines. He had been very successful in
taking prizes in the science classes at college.
The science of optics was a strong point with
him, so he set to to compose ‘A Dissertation on
the Polarisation of Light.’ This he sent when
completed to a celebrated science monthly. The
manuscript was returned, and the note accompanying
it was discouraging. The editor thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">{653}</span>
the article fairly well written, and the facts and
theories were correctly given so far as it went,
but it was rather behind the times. Repulsed
in the higher branches of his chosen profession,
he now condescended to write ordinary magazine
sketches and stories; but still the long-looked-for
success failed to come. He wrote scores of
papers—tales, social sketches, &amp;c.; but not one
of them found their way into print. In most
cases they were returned with a printed form
of letter, expressive of the editor’s regret at
being unable to use the manuscript. In some
cases, however, they were good enough to append
a line or two of criticism. One said his style
was a little stilted, and that he used too many
long-syllabled words. Another said, in effect, that
he lacked dramatic instinct in the grouping of his
incidents and characters, and that the plot was
bald and destitute of any probable <i>motif</i>. Many
never returned his manuscripts at all, or paid
the least attention to his oft repeated inquiries
regarding them. Disheartened by these repeated
failures, it was with delight he read in one of
the daily papers an advertisement addressed ‘To
Authors.’ The advertiser, who seemed to be of
a philanthropic disposition, professed deep sympathy
with the difficulties that beset the path
of young aspirants to literary fame. Many a
splendid intellect, the advertisement went on
to say, had been doomed to languish in obscurity
through the want of enterprise of selfish publishers.
It was his (the advertiser’s) wish to
assist struggling merit—in other words, to enable
young authors to publish their works on exceptionally
favourable terms. Letters inclosing a
stamped envelope for reply, and addressed to
‘Author,’ G. P. O., London, would receive instant
attention.</p>

<p>‘The very thing to meet my case,’ said Alfred
to himself. ‘I’ll write a novel, and then these
beggarly editors will see how the public will
appreciate my writings.’ In high spirits he wrote
a letter asking further particulars from the literary
philanthropist; and in due course received a courteous
reply, stating that if he forwarded the manuscript
of the proposed work when finished, it would
be examined carefully, and, if judged worthy,
would be published on the ‘half-profit’ system—that
is, the resulting profits to be equally divided
between the author and the advertiser. It was
necessary that a registration fee of ten guineas
should be paid in the first instance; this, however,
was only as a guarantee of bona fides, and it
would be returned when the book was published.
The requisite fee was at once forwarded; and
Alfred set to work in great spirits to compose
a short high-class novel; he purposed giving the
story a literary <i>personnel</i>, to afford him an opportunity
of holding up to his readers’ derisive scorn
the ridiculous pretensions of ignorant London
editors. He wrote to Anne, and depicted in
glowing terms the brilliant prospects before him
in the near future; and putting his whole soul
in his work, and working twelve hours a day,
he finished his story (which was somewhat after
the style of the <i>Caxtons</i>) in less than two months.
In sending it to London, he earnestly requested
that it should be put in type and published with
the least possible delay. The manuscript was
duly acknowledged, and compliance with his request
promised. It had been handed to the
reader, who would at once set to work on it;
and his fee was ten guineas, payable in advance.
Poor Alfred’s store of sovereigns was now pretty
well reduced, and it was with reluctance that
he sent this second remittance. In a week his
manuscript was returned with a polite note,
saying that while the story showed germs of
genius, it was not of sufficient general literary
merit to warrant publication. Inquiries made
through a London friend revealed the fact that
he had been the victim of a used-up penny-a-liner,
a man without means, influence, or respectability,
who made a discreditable living by playing
on the credulity and vanity of amateur
authors. Dark despair would have taken hold
of most people in his circumstances; his money
was now reduced to a trifle; his health affected
by his prolonged and severe efforts; but his
self-esteem was in no way abated. He still
believed literature to be his forte, and determined
to give it <i>one</i> more chance. First of all, though,
he required rest; and having an invitation from
Nan, he took the train one day for Lochenbreck,
where he arrived with a portmanteau full of
rejected manuscripts, and ten pounds in his
pocket.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BLEEDING_HEART_YARD">BLEEDING HEART YARD.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the demolition of Bleeding Heart Yard,
many a pilgrim to London will have one goal
the less. But it has been too graphically pictured
in <i>Little Dorrit</i> ever to be forgotten. Of
all Dickens’ many sketches of the London slums,
this is one of the best, although it requires
great imaginative powers now to recognise here
any ‘relish of ancient greatness.’ The ‘mighty
stacks of chimneys,’ now much the worse for wear,
are still here, and still ‘give the Yard a character.’
But the poor people who had ‘a family sentimental
feeling’ about the Yard have nearly all
flitted, like rats from a sinking ship. Indeed,
piles of massive warehouses, which have sprung
up on all sides, have already almost swamped
their habitations; and any one seeing them in
the gray gloaming of a wet winter afternoon, will
have some difficulty in devising pleas for their
preservation. The Yard is altogether dreary and
unlovely, now that it is deserted, save for a couple
of workshops, which, possibly, have replaced the
factory of Daniel Doyce. A few carriers’ carts
and costers’ barrows, too, seem to have been left
here by accident. But for the most part the
picture is one of dilapidated desolation. The
three-storied brown-brick houses with their low-pitched
red-tiled roofs, that run down the
southern side, seem to have been the scene of
an explosion or a conflagration; or, possibly, they
may have been besieged by an army of urchins.
Anyhow, not a pane of glass remains in the
windows, which were probably cut through the
wall at odd times, when wanted; and but for
a tattered fringe which still decorates the frames,
they might never have been glazed. Some of
the cart-sheds and stables which form the ground-floor—to
use an appellation that properly belongs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">{654}</span>
to suburban villas—have been converted into
shops, but bear no signs of ever having done a
thriving trade; and it is easy to believe that
the Yard, ‘though as willing a yard as any in
Britain,’ was never ‘the better for any demand for
labour.’</p>

<p>But whatever its past, before very long it will
have been improved away, and visitors will probably
soon have some difficulty in finding out
even its site. The witchery of Dickens is shown
in nothing so much as the atmosphere of vivid
actuality with which he surrounded nearly all
his characters, and the localities in which they
lived and moved. For years, crowds have paid
visits of devotion to the shrines which he has
surrounded with such a halo of romance; and
he possessed in a remarkable degree the faculty
of appropriating all the charm with which legend
and tradition had surrounded spots, and endowing
them with a new glamour, until he made himself
the true <i>genius loci</i>. His knowledge of London
was certainly ‘extensive and peculiar.’ It would
be easy to name a dozen nooks within a stone’s
throw of Holborn alone which he made his own.
The narrow and crowded streets which, when
Dickens wrote, were even more squalid than
they are now, had for him an irresistible attraction.
From his chambers in Furnival’s Inn as
a centre, he was a veritable explorer in all directions;
and he has painted for us with his pen
a series of sketches of these courts and alleys the
realism of which the pencil of even George
Cruikshank could not rival.</p>

<p>The nomenclature of London presents an endless
succession of problems which never seem to
get much nearer solution; and so far as many
disputed sites are concerned, there is every likelihood
that they will soon be removed from the
field of controversy by being obliterated and
altogether forgotten. It is notoriously a perpetual
cause of surprise to foreigners, and especially our
American cousins, that we are so heedless of
being a nation with a history as to take no pains
to preserve our historical landmarks. There are
a thousand-and-one buried sites in the streets
of London alone, which have played their parts
in our national and municipal development, and
there is none that cares to put up a stone to
preserve their traditions from oblivion. But for
Bleeding Heart Yard no very heroic etymology
can be claimed. Dickens, it is to be feared, drew
largely on his imagination, which he doubtless
found served him in better stead than any number
of old folios, for his amusing derivations. Except
in <i>Little Dorrit</i>, there seems to be but scanty
authority for the tradition that this was the scene
of a murder. It is, however, beyond dispute
that Ely Place and the adjacent streets were
occupied by the luxurious town palace of the
Bishops of Ely. Within the walls were included
twenty acres of ground. This was, about the
year 1577, sold to Christopher Hatton by the
Bishop of Ely, who was, however, only made to
carry out the contract by Elizabeth’s memorable
threat that otherwise she would unfrock him.
It was here that the famous chancellor died in
1591. But his house and garden do not seem
to have been demolished until the middle of the
seventeenth century, for Evelyn, writing in 1659,
tells us how he went to see ‘the foundations
now laying for a long street and buildings in
Hatton Garden, designed for a little town, lately
an ample garden.’ Of a certain Lady Hatton,
probably the wife of Sir Christopher’s great-nephew,
it is gravely recorded that she had a
compact with the Evil One, and that on the
night when this came to an end, that personage,
in the guise of a cavalier, attended certain festivities
which were being held at Hatton House,
and having lured her into the garden, tore
her in pieces—her ‘bleeding heart’ being afterwards
found. But if this weird legend had
even so solid a foundation as a murder, it is
probable that some record of it would have
survived.</p>

<p><i>Little Dorrit</i> is also the authority for the story
of the young lady who was closely imprisoned
in her chamber here by her cruel father for
refusing to marry the suitor he had chosen for
her. The legend related how the young lady
used to be seen up at her window behind the
bars, murmuring a love-lorn song, of which the
burden was, ‘Bleeding heart, bleeding heart,
bleeding away,’ until she died. It will be
remembered that although the Yard was divided
in opinion, this story carried the day by a great
majority, notwithstanding that it was supposed
to have originated with ‘a tambour-worker, a
spinster, and romantic,’ living in the Yard.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that the point
has received the attention of the seekers after
miscellaneous knowledge, and a number of alternative
derivations have been suggested. One
learned antiquary, for instance, reminds us that
‘bleeding heart’ is the name of the red wallflower
in certain parts of England, but omits to point
out the connection. The most plausible is the
suggestion that the court may have taken its
name from a hostel known as the <i>Bleeding
Hart</i>, and it is well known that sign-painters
frequently prove shaky in their orthography.
Thus, he records that in Warwickshire, an inn
known as the <i>White Hart</i> was some years since
adorned with a signboard representing a human
heart, or at least an ace of hearts. Then some
people still cling to the belief that the sign of
the Bleeding Heart dates from pre-Reformation
times, and is emblematical of the five sorrowful
mysteries of the rosary. We must leave it to
others to reconcile these conflicting theories. But
for its associations with the fortunes of <i>Little
Dorrit</i>, the bare existence of the court would
certainly have remained in oblivion, and its
demolition would have excited no unusual
regret.</p>

<p>But there are those for whom the Yard has
been associated with the history of a set of very
real personages. Hither many folk have gone
in search of ‘the domicile of Plornish, plasterer,’
and have sought to identify ‘the parlour’ in which
the Plornish family lived, and which was pointed
out to callers by ‘the painted hand, on the forefinger
of which the artist had depicted a ring,
and a most elaborate nail of the genteelest
form.’ Here, too, they have probably pictured
for themselves the Patriarch ‘floating serenely
through the Yard in the forenoon’ with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">{655}</span>
express purpose of getting up trustfulness in
his shining bumps and silken locks, to be succeeded
a few hours later by Pancks, that prince
of rent-collectors, who, ‘perspiring, and puffing
and darting about in eccentric directions, and
becoming hotter and dingier every moment,
lashed the tide of the Yard into the most
agitated and turbid state.’ They may further
have looked for the small grocery and general
dealer’s shop ‘at the crack end of the Yard,’
where Mrs Plornish was established by Mr Dorrit;
and for ‘Happy Cottage,’ that most wonderful
of interiors. And they may have wondered
whereabouts was the spot where Pancks tackled
the Patriarch, snipped off short the sacred locks,
and cut down the broad-brimmed hat to a
stewpan, thereby converting the venerable Casby,
‘that first-rate humbug of a thousand guns,’ into
‘a bare-polled, goggle-eyed phantom.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="FLEET_STREET_MARRIAGES">FLEET STREET MARRIAGES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is said that the Fleet Street marriages of
London originated with the incumbents of Trinity,
Minories, and St James’s, Duke Place. The incumbents
claimed to be exempt from the jurisdiction
of the Bishop of London, and performed the marriages
without banns or license. It is not exactly
known in what year these gentlemen started their
lucrative profession; but one named Elliot, who
was rector of St James’s, was suspended by
the Bishop of London in 1616 for performing
these ceremonies. The trade was then taken up
by clerical prisoners living within the Rules of
the Fleet; and Mr Burn tells us that, as a
rule, these were just the men—having neither
money, character, nor liberty to lose—to adopt
the profession; and he further says that they
were in the main ‘lusty jolly fellows, but
thorough rogues and vagabonds, guilty of various
offences.’ That they were not ashamed of the
business is evident from the fact that they advertised
in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of that year to the
following effect: ‘G. R.—At the true chapel, at
the old <i>Red Hand and Mitre</i>, three doors up
Fleet Lane, and next door to the <i>White Swan</i>,
marriages are performed by authority by the
Rev. Mr Symson, educated at the university of
Cambridge, and late chaplain to the Earl of
Rothes.—<i>N.B.</i> Without imposition.’</p>

<p>‘J. Lilley, at the <i>Hand and Pen</i>, next door to
the China Shop, Fleet Bridge, London, will be
performed the solemnisation of marriages by a
gentleman regularly bred at one of our universities,
and lawfully ordained according to the
institutions of the Church of England, and is
ready to wait on any person in town or
country.’</p>

<p>There must have been great competition in the
business, for we are told that there might be seen
in corners of windows tickets stating ‘Weddings
performed cheap here,’ ‘The Old and True
Register,’ &amp;c. But the great trade was at the
‘marriage houses’ whose landlords were also
publicans, the <i>Bishop Blaire</i>, the <i>Horseshoe and
Magpie</i>, the <i>Fighting Cocks</i>, the <i>Sawyers</i>, the <i>Hand
and Pen</i>, the <i>Bull and Garter</i>, and the <i>King’s
Head</i>, the last two being kept by warders of the
Fleet prison.</p>

<p>The parson and landlord—the latter usually
acting as clerk—divided the fees between them,
after paying a shilling to the tout who brought
in the customers.</p>

<p>The <i>Grub Street Journal</i> of January 1735 has
the following: ‘There are a set of drunken,
swearing parsons, with their myrmidons, who
wear black coats, and pretend to be clerks and
registers of the Fleet, and who ply about Ludgate
Hill, pulling and forcing people to some peddling
alehouse or brandy-shop to be married; even
on a Sunday, stopping them as they are going
to church and almost tearing their clothes off
their backs.’</p>

<p>This is confirmed by Pennant, who says: ‘In
walking along the streets in my youth, on the
side next the prison, I have often been tempted
by the question, “Sir, will you be pleased to
walk in and be married?” The parson was seen
walking before his shop, a squalid, profligate
figure, clad in a tattered plaid nightgown, with
a fiery face, and ready to couple you for a dram
of gin or a roll of tobacco.’</p>

<p>Ladies who were possessed, or supposed to
possess means, were often kidnapped and forced
to marry ruffians whom they had never seen.
For instance, we read that a young lady of birth
and fortune was forced from her friends, ‘and
by the assistance of a wry-necked swearing parson,
married to an atheistical wretch, whose life was
a continual practice of all manner of vice.’</p>

<p>Again, we learn that a young lady appointed
to meet a gentlewoman at the Old Playhouse,
Drury Lane; but something prevented the gentlewoman
coming, and the young lady being alone
when the play was over, told a boy to fetch a
coach for the city. ‘One like a gentleman helps
her into it and jumps in after her. “Madam,”
says he, “this coach was called for me; and since
the weather is bad and there is no other, I beg
leave to bear you company. I am going into the
city, and will set you down wherever you
please.”’</p>

<p>The girl begged to be excused; but the man
told the coachman to drive on. The result was
that she was driven to a house, where she was
induced to go in on the pretext of seeing the
man’s sister, who would accompany her the rest
of the journey. The sister came, but immediately
vanished, and in her place appeared a
‘tawny fellow in a black coat and black wig,’
who said: ‘Madam, you are come in good time;
the doctor was just agoing!’</p>

<p>‘The doctor!’ exclaimed the girl; ‘what has the
doctor to do with me?’</p>

<p>‘To marry you to that gentleman. The doctor
has waited for you these three hours, and will
be paid by you or that gentleman before you
go!’</p>

<p>‘That gentleman,’ replied the girl, recovering
herself, ‘is worthy a better fortune than mine,’
and begged to be allowed to go; but the men
were obdurate; and when she found she could
not escape without money or pledge, told them
that she liked the gentleman so much, that
she would meet him the next night and be
married; but they did not allow her to go
before she had given them some pledge, and
she therefore gave them a ring, which, to quote
her words, ‘was my mother’s gift on her death-bed,
enjoining that, if ever I married, it should
be my wedding ring;’ and by this means she
escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">{656}</span></p>

<p>The indecency of these practices, and the
facility they afforded for accomplishing forced
and fraudulent marriages, were not the only
evils, for we are told that marriages, when
entered in the register, could be antedated without
limit, on payment of a fee, or not entered
at all; and women frequently hired temporary
husbands at the Fleet, in order that they might
be able to plead marriage to an action for debt.
These hired husbands were provided by the parsons
at five shillings each; and we are told that
one man was married four times under different
names, and received five shillings on each occasion
‘for his trouble.’</p>

<p>That the parsons did not always get the best
of it may be supposed from the following extract
from the register of the Fleet Marriages: ‘1740.
Geo. Grant and Ann Gordon, bachelor and spinster:
stole my clothes-brush.’—‘Married at a
barber’s shop next Wilson’s—namely, one Kerrils,
for half a guinea; after which it was extorted
out of my pocket, and for fear of my life,
delivered.’</p>

<p>We are told that all sorts and conditions of
men flocked to the Fleet to be married in haste,
from the barber to the officer in the Guards—from
the pauper to the peer. Timbs, in his
book on <i>London</i>, states that among the aristocratic
patrons of these unlicensed clergy were
Lord Abergavenny; the Honourable John Bourke,
afterwards Viscount Mayo; Sir Marmaduke
Gresham; Lord Banff; Lord Montague, afterwards
Duke of Manchester; Viscount Sligo; the
Marquis of Annandale; Henry Fox, afterwards
Lord Holland; and others. Walpole writes to
Sir Horace Mann about Fox’s marriage as
follows: ‘The town has been in a great bustle
about a private match, but which, by the
ingenuity of the ministry, has been made
politics. Mr Fox fell in love with Lady
Caroline Lennox (eldest daughter of the Duke of
Richmond), asked her, was refused, and stole her.
His father was a footman; her great-grandfather,
a king. All the blood-royal have been up in
arms.’</p>

<p>The Bishop of London attempted to put a
stop to these marriages in 1702, but with very
little effect; and it was not until 1754 that an
Act of Parliament was passed to prevent them.
It is stated that the day before the Act was to
come into force (March 24), there were no
fewer than two hundred and seventeen marriages
recorded in one register book; and these were
the last of the Fleet weddings.</p>

<p>A collection of the registers of Fleet Marriages
was made in 1821, and was purchased by the
government; they weighed over a ton.</p>

<p>After the Marriage Bill of 1754, the Savoy
Chapel came into vogue. The following advertisement
appeared in the <i>Public Advertiser</i> of
January 2, 1754: ‘By authority—Marriages performed
with the utmost privacy, decency, and
regularity at the ancient royal chapel of St John
the Baptist, in the Savoy, where regular and
authentic registers have been kept from the time
of the Reformation (being two hundred years
and upwards) to this day. The expenses not
more than one guinea—the five-shilling stamp
included. There are five private ways by land to
this chapel, and two by water.’</p>

<p>The proprietor of this chapel was the Rev.
John Wilkinson, who fancied—as the Savoy was
extra-parochial—that he was privileged to issue
licenses upon his own authority, and so took no
notice of the Act. During the following year,
1755, he married no fewer than eleven hundred
and ninety couples. The authorities at last took
the matter up, and Wilkinson went into hiding;
but he got a curate named Grierson to perform the
ceremonies, he still giving the licenses, by which
he thought his assistant would be harmless; but
this was not so. Two members of the Drury
Lane company were united by Grierson; and
Garrick hearing of this, obtained the certificate,
and had Grierson arrested. He was tried, convicted,
and sentenced to fourteen years’ transportation;
by which sentence, we are told, fourteen
hundred marriages were declared void. We
are not told what became of Wilkinson, whose
trade was thus put a stop to.</p>
